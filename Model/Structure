 
 Let X be the number of water bottles transffered at facility
    X can be both Positive and Negative
        Pick up = Negative
        Drop off = Positive


Static Constraints

    Truck capacity < Total Storage



    
    FacilityDemand = 0
    FacilityInventory >= 0



How Do we Solve this method?
Brute force?
    Absolutely Not, there are an unlimited number of possibilities

Through Math? Good luck


Branch And Bound? Now this reasonable. 
But lets modify this idea, Lets think of this problem Backwards
Instead of picking up supply and delivering, Lets pick up Demand and drop it off at supply.

Why Does this work?
The Cheapest Most efficient system is going to leverage maximizing load capacity
a truck can only pick up  a certain demand because of its capacity. 

If a county Fully fills one or more trucks, then the only location those trucks can go is a supplier, This stops the route length at 1
This enables us to run an "initialization run" where we turn essentially use full trucks to scale down the problem.
